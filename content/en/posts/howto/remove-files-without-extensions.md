## Introduction

In production environments, it's not uncommon to encounter files without extensions. These files can be hard to manage and may clutter up directories, making file operations more difficult. This blog post will guide you through writing a bash script that removes files without extensions from a given directory. The script is designed to be production-ready, meaning it includes logging and error handling to ensure safe and traceable file cleanup.

## Why Remove Files Without Extensions?

Files without extensions are often left behind accidentally or are remnants from incomplete processes. Without extensions, file types are not easily identifiable, which can cause issues when performing file operations, backups, or even data integrity checks. By removing these files, you can:

- Reduce clutter and maintain a cleaner file structure.
- Ensure that only properly named files remain in the directory.
- Prevent potential issues in file processing or automated tasks.

## Bash Script for Removing Files Without Extensions

Hereâ€™s the bash script that will clean up files in a directory that do not have file extensions.

### Script Explanation

This bash script performs the following tasks:
1. Accepts a target directory as input (defaults to the current directory if no directory is provided).
2. Checks if the directory exists.
3. Lists all files in the directory and checks if they have an extension.
4. Logs every action with a timestamp.
5. Removes files that do not have an extension.

### The Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to remove files without a file extension in a given directory
# This script is production-ready and logs all actions.

TARGET_DIR="${1:-.}"
LOG_FILE="remove_files.log"

log_message() {
    local MESSAGE="$1"
    local TIMESTAMP
    TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    echo "$TIMESTAMP - $MESSAGE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    log_message "ERROR: Target directory '$TARGET_DIR' does not exist!"
    echo "ERROR: Target directory '$TARGET_DIR' does not exist!"
    exit 1
fi

log_message "INFO: Starting cleanup in '$TARGET_DIR'..."

find "$TARGET_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f | while read -r FILE; do
    BASENAME=$(basename "$FILE")

    # Remove if there's no '.' in the filename OR ends with a dot (hidden files like `.bashrc` are preserved)
    if [[ "$BASENAME" != *.* ]]; then
        log_message "INFO: Removing file without extension: $FILE"
        rm -f "$FILE"
    fi
done

log_message "INFO: Cleanup completed."
echo "Cleanup completed. See $LOG_FILE for details."

```

### How the Script Works

1. **Logging**: Every action, including the deletion of files and any errors, is logged with a timestamp. This allows for easy tracking of what has been removed and provides an audit trail.
2. **Directory Check**: The script checks if the directory exists before performing any file operations. If the directory is invalid, an error message is logged.
3. **File Iteration**: The script uses the `find` command to list all files in the specified directory. It then checks each file to see if it has a valid extension using a regular expression.
4. **File Removal**: Files without extensions are removed, and the action is logged for transparency.

### Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `remove_files_without_extension.sh`.

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x remove_files_without_extension.sh
   ```

3. Run the script, passing the target directory as an argument. If no directory is provided, it will default to the current directory:

   ```bash
   ./remove_files_without_extension.sh /path/to/your/directory
   ```

4. Check the `remove_files.log` file for details on the files that were removed and any errors encountered.

### Why This Script Is Production-Ready

* **Logging**: The script logs every action, including any errors, to a log file, ensuring traceability and allowing administrators to review what actions were taken.
* **Error Handling**: The script checks if the directory exists and prevents accidental file deletions.
* **Flexibility**: It works with any directory and can be easily customized for additional file operations if necessary.

## Conclusion

Removing files without extensions can improve your directory management and prevent unnecessary clutter in production environments. This bash script provides a safe, automated way to clean up such files while keeping a log for accountability and troubleshooting.

Make sure to test this script in a non-production environment before deploying it to ensure it works as expected in your specific use case.
